## Chat App

Chatting model: Group chat

The server is an intermediary between the clients. It receives a message from one client and forwards it to all other clients except the one from which the message came from. 

To join the chat, each client must provide their username for identifcation by other clients in the chat. However, the server uniquely identifies the clients by their ip addresses.
